    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    Going back and checking the code is correct without any errors will be the first step to making sure it is functional.  Next would be to run tests with different inputs to ensure there is no errors later in the future.  Lastly, if possible have someone else test it out to see they catch any errors you might have missed.
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    Asking users what they would like to see in a program is the simple way of understanding what they want.  Another way is to look back to other successful programs and understand what makes them stand out or why users like to use them.
    
    How do I approach designing software?
    Start by understanding what it is you want it to acheive or do.  Then go through what resources needed to complete it or at least to start it.  Afterwards build a plan on the main components and work your way in to making sure they all work together effectively.
